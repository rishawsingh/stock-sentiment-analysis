- Since 2006, Twitter has been a continuously growing source of information, keeping us informed about all and nothing. It is estimated that more than 6,000 tweets are exchanged on the platform every second, making it an inexhaustible mine of information that it would be a shame not to use.

- Fortunately, there are different ways to process tweets in an automated way, and retrieve precise information in an instant.
 
- In this project, I learned all the steps necessary to build your own Tweet Sentiment prediction model using Text Mining, NLP and Machine Learning. 

- The objective of this project is to pursue a very precise goal (Sentiment Analysis) and deepen all the necessary steps in order to reach this goal, by using the appropriate tools.
